# API ↔ UI coverage matrix (CloudSignage)

**Purpose:** Track which backend routes are exercised by the dashboard or player, and UX maturity (loading / error / empty). Priorities: **P0** launch blocker, **P1** should fix before GA, **P2** polish.

**Legend:** ✓ wired | ~ partial | — not used from UI | UX: L/E/D = loading / error / empty states reviewed
