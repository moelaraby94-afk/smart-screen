# 02 — Customer Domain

> **Document Type:** Domain Design Specification
> **Status:** Architecture Design — Pre-Implementation
> **Scope:** Complete customer module catalog for the Customer Workspace

---

## 1. Overview

The Customer Domain encompasses every module that the customer interacts with. These modules are customer-facing, accessed through the Customer Workspace. Platform staff never access these modules directly (except through impersonation).

### Design Principles

1. **Customer modules are workspace-scoped** — every request includes a `workspaceId`, validated against membership
2. **Customer modules never know about platform operations** — no tenant management, no platform settings, no staff roles
3. **Customer modules enforce plan limits** — screen count, storage, API calls are checked against subscription
4. **Customer modules are self-served** — customers can do everything without contacting support
5. **Customer modules degrade gracefully** — maintenance mode, quota exceeded, and feature disabled states are handled with clear messaging

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Should customers have a "support" link** that creates a ticket in the platform Support Center? Yes — but through a public API, not through platform UI.
2. **Should customers see platform announcements** (maintenance, new features)? Yes — via a banner controlled by Platform Settings.
3. **Should customers be able to request a plan upgrade** that goes to the platform sales team? Yes — via a form that creates a support ticket.
4. **Should the impersonation banner show the admin's name** to the customer? No — the customer should not know they're being impersonated unless the platform configures "transparent impersonation."
5. **Should customers have access to their own audit log** (workspace-scoped)? Yes — a read-only view of workspace events.
